        Leo Vinyls manufactures Vinyls also known with Synthetic leather,
        artificial leather and PVC leather cloth as well. Synthetic leather is
        being used in many areas like: Automotive upholstery, footwear, luggage,
        finishing and sports industries. As the name implies this Synthetic
        leather has leather attributes but somehow artificially made.
        Must say that synthetic leather has classy and elegant look that of a
        leather but maintaince is quite low with synthetic leather textile
        fabric. So give your stuff, elegant look of leather along with the
        versatility of synthetic leather cloth.
